# UT EIoF webtool

This is the open source code for the UT-Austin Energy Institutes Energy Infrastructure of the Future web tool. 

**Tasks to complete for open sourcing**

1. Go through code and remove redundant code, commented out code, unnecessary comments
2. Add in clarifying comments
3. Remove anything involving docker (other users should not need this since they won't be connecting to the website)
4. Figure out how to prevent users to access the googlesheets
5. Automate running code with a csv file?
6. Provide instructions on setting up model and conducting a run
   - Maybe create a script that installs all necessary R packages
7. Provide descriptions of code and data files


Questions
generate_FinalUVY_2050.R has a lot of commented out code. I think it would be best for Carey to take a look so I don't accidently remove anything I shouldn't.
