# UT-Austin Energy Institute Energy Infrastructure of the Future (EIoF) Project current server instructions

**note that these will change when the code is moved to another non-UT system**

## Project purpose
The EIoF project seeks to build a tool that allows users to make large-scale changes to how and what types of energy are consumed in the US economy and then quickly see the implications of those choices. The tool consists of two parts 1) a publicly-available website where users can make simple changes to how different regions in the US consume energy and 2) a suite of codes (programed in R) running on a remote server that process the users choices and send back answers that are displayed on the aforementioned website (henceforth called the *code*). 


## Website
The website is currently being developed by the Faculty Technology Studio at UT-Austin. The test version can be found here: TBD

## Current code location
The code is currently located on TACC's Rodeo system at the IP address: `129.114.6.122` and are accessed via the command line or terminal in Linux/Mac, or via the BASH plug in for Windows 10. It is unclear if they can be accessed with earlier versions of Windows. Basic Linux command knowledge will be assumed, some basics can be learned here: https://www.guru99.com/must-know-linux-commands.html

*Carey to put Windows terminal/BASH installation instructions for this document*

Currently, the system is accessed through a `.pem` file that has been provided by David Walling (TACC). To access the
