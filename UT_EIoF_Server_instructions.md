**note that these will change when the code is moved to another non-UT system**

## Current code location
The code is currently located on TACC's Rodeo system at the IP address: `129.114.6.122` and are accessed via the command line or terminal in Linux/Mac, or via the BASH plugin for Windows 10. It is unclear if they can be accessed with earlier versions of Windows. Basic Linux command knowledge will be assumed, some basics can be learned here: https://www.guru99.com/must-know-linux-commands.html

*Carey to put Windows terminal/BASH instaliation instructions for this document*

Currently, the system is accessed through a `.pem` file that has been provided by David Walling (TACC).
